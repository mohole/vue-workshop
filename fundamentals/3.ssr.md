# Server Side Render & Frameworks
For almost a decade the Single Page Applications was the de-facto standard solution when building complex projects with HTML/CSS/JS. 

However in the last few years the Server Side Render Frameworks are at the center of a growing momentum.

## The challenges with SPAs
Some downsides with SPA that are solved with SSR:

* **no SEO**, everything you do with "pages" in a SPA is not going to be parsed & indexed by search engines.
* **TTI metrics**, static pages have faster response times but huge JS bundles may take some time to be parsed and executed, while a SSR page has usually a higher response time but lower TTI.
* **waiting times**, in SPA you can get the initial data loading only after the JS has been parsed, executed and the components are mounted in the page, resulting in a quite long waterfall sequence.

## Why SSR Frameworks are different from "classic" server side languages
Compared to PHP, Python, Java and all of the other languages that have a server side templating:

* are **Node.js** only
* integrate with a frontend library
    * Next.js `-->` React
    * Nuxt `-->` Vue
    * SvelteKit `-->` Svelte
    * Astro `-->` *
* it's not just purely SSR, there is also an **hydration** (*or universal rendering*) mechanism that inject the client side code after the first loading
* use the same components on both server and client

this concepts are better explained and visualized in [the Nuxt docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering).
