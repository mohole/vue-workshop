# Application Program Interface

## What is an API?
It is just a fancy acronym to say "how a functionality is exposed to the developers" when we use something like `.querySelector('#something')` we are using a DOM API to retrieve an element from the page giving a CSS selector.

APIs also works as "contracts" to expose the functionality in a predictable way without requiring to know how the underlying code works.

## RESTful APIs
REpresentative State of Transer is a well consolidated paradigm used in latest 15+ years by developers to exchange informations between two applications (*mostrly client <--> servers, but also servers <--> servers*).
