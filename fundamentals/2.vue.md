# Why Vue.js?

* easy to learn
* closer to web standards (*templates are normal HTML*)
* SFC helps keeping HTML, CSS and JS separated
* consistent tooling & ecosystem (routing, test, Vite, Nuxt, etc..)

## It's like smaller HTML pages
At its simplest form, a Vue component could be something just like this:

```html
<!-- footer.vue -->
<template>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright Mohole 2023</p>
  </footer>
</template>
```

so as you can see its plain HTML, except that it doesn't contain a whole page and the `.vue` file can contain also sytles and scripts

```html
<!-- footer.vue -->
<template>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright Mohole 2023</p>
  </footer>
</template>

<style>
  footer p { color: blue }
</style>
```

regarding Javascript there is just a minor difference:

```html
<!-- footer.vue -->
<script setup>
const year = new Date().getFullYear()
</script>

<template>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright Mohole {{ year }}</p>
  </footer>
</template>

<style>
  footer p { color: blue }
</style>
```

the `setup` keyword in the `<script>` tag is a Vue option to enable some most recent features (*the Compose API*), but beside that so far is plain old Javascript.

The `{{ value }}` syntaxt in the HTML block is a Vue feature, it's a binding expression that allows you to read a value from the `<script>` into the `<template>` without the need to use Javascript's DOM APIs.

## There is more than meets the eyes
We are just scratching the surface here, but we are going dive a little bit deeper in the next few hours...
