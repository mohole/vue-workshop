# Why Vue.js?

- easy to learn
- closer to web standards (_templates are normal HTML_)
- SFC helps keeping HTML, CSS and JS separated
- consistent tooling & ecosystem (routing, test, Vite, Nuxt, etc..)

## It's like smaller HTML pages

At its simplest form, a Vue component could be something just like this:

```html
<!-- Footer.vue -->
<template>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright Mohole 2023</p>
  </footer>
</template>
```

so as you can see its plain HTML, except that it doesn't contain a whole page and the `.vue` file can contain also sytles and scripts

```html
<!-- Footer.vue -->
<template>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright Mohole 2023</p>
  </footer>
</template>

<style>
  footer p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

regarding Javascript there is just a minor difference:

```html
<!-- Footer.vue -->
<script setup>
  const year = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>

<template>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright Mohole {{ year }}</p>
  </footer>
</template>

<style>
  footer p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

the `setup` keyword in the `<script>` tag is a Vue option to enable some most recent features (_the Compose API_), but beside that so far is plain old Javascript.

The `{{ value }}` syntaxt in the HTML block is a Vue feature, it's a binding expression that allows you to read a value from the `<script>` into the `<template>` without the need to use Javascript's DOM APIs.

## Using our component

Then, as we said before, we will be able to use this component inside anther Vue component template just by referecing its name

```html
<!-- Index.vue -->
<template>
  <h1>Some random title</h1>
  <Footer />
</template>
```

## There is more than meets the eyes

We are just scratching the surface here, but we are going dive a little bit deeper in the next few hours...
