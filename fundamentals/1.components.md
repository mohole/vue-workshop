# Thinking in components

## What is a component?
It's a piece of code that represent a single piece of a UI.

Ideally a component should be as small as possibile and are responsible of a single activity.

When consumed, a component look like a regular HTML tag but with special name and custom attributes.

```html
<section>
  <h1>Choose a Movie<h1>
    <!-- Example of using a component -->
  <MovieCarousel category="action" />
<section>
```

**React, Vue and Angular (*and others...*) are all components based UI development libraries.**

## Playing with LEGO
With components we follow a pattern that describes an UI by "slicing" it in small elements and then putting them together like a Lego building.

Components can be splitted in two main categories:

* **stateless** - components that have zero or very simple internal business logic, they are mostly configure from "outside" and are highly reusable
* **stateful** - components that may expose very few visual elements but have important business logic (*getting data, coordinating other components, handling side effects*)
